Research at Herzberg
At the Herzberg Astronomy and Astrophysics Research Centre, we conduct world-class research across a broad range of astrophysics. We have access to current and future premier facilities like SKA, CHORD, ALMA, Rubin Observatory, Gemini Observatory, Canada France Hawaii Telescope, and state-of-the-art labs. I am also part of the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre at Herzberg which provides world-leading data services and cloud computing.
We offer four regular postdoctoral fellowship programs, including the Plaskett Fellowship, Covington Fellowship, and Instrument Science Fellowship. Additionally, the NRC runs an annual open postdoctoral program.My research regularly generates opportunities and projects for graduate students as well as a chance to collaborate with leading astronomers around the world. If you’re a prospective graduate student interested in related research areas, I strongly encourage you to apply to the University of Victoria's Astronomy program. 
For postdoctoral researchers who share the interests above, I’m always open to discussing fellowship proposals, and I recommend considering the postdoctoral positions at Herzberg and NRC.
